## Why do we need Generative AI instead of simple sentiment analysis?

Simple sentiment analysis only tells us whether feedback is positive or negative. It cannot explain why the customer feels that way or what exactly went wrong. Generative AI is used because it can understand the full context of the review. It can identify whether the feedback is about fit, quality, delivery, or service, summarise the issue, and suggest clear actions for the retail team. This makes the analysis more useful for real business decisions.

## What does "detect which product or service each feedback refers to" mean?

This means understanding what the customer is talking about in their review.

- **Product-related feedback** includes fit, size, fabric, quality, or price of the item.
- **Service-related feedback** includes delivery experience, returns, or customer support.

There is no separate service column in the dataset. The AI model reads the review text and identifies whether the feedback is about a product issue or a service-related issue.

## What does "summarise insights by product category and urgency level" mean?

This means grouping customer feedback in a way that helps teams take quick action.

- **Product category** comes from existing data such as department names (for example: Dresses, Tops).
- **Urgency level** is not directly given and is understood from the review text.

Based on the review:

- **High urgency** — serious complaints or critical problems
- **Medium urgency** — delivery delays or repeated issues
- **Low urgency** — minor issues, suggestions, or positive feedback

## What is Zero-Shot Prompting in this project?

Zero-Shot Prompting means giving the AI clear instructions without providing any examples.

The model is asked to analyse each review and generate:

- Category
- Sentiment
- Summary
- Personalised Message
- Retail Insight

The goal is to test prompt clarity, not to train the model.

---

## How do we design a Zero-Shot prompt for this task?

A Zero-Shot prompt is designed by:

- Clearly defining the model's role
- Listing all required outputs
- Defining allowed values (such as Positive, Negative, Neutral)
- Keeping the instructions clear and structured

No examples are given in the prompt.

---

## What does "Category" mean in the AI output?

Category refers to the type of feedback, not the product category.

Examples of categories include:

- Fit
- Quality
- Delivery
- Price
- Other

These categories help identify which part of the customer experience the feedback relates to.

---

## How is urgency identified if it is not present in the dataset?

Urgency is identified by reading the review text and understanding the seriousness of the issue.

For example:

- **Strong complaints or safety concerns** — high urgency
- **Delivery or service delays** — medium urgency
- **Suggestions or positive comments** — low urgency

The AI model helps infer this from the language used by the customer.
